Calculate plant based meal on average saves per category:

A balanced meal typically consists of the following components:
Vegetables and Fruits (40-50% of the meal):
~200-250 g (e.g., salad, steamed vegetables, or fruit as a side).
Grains or Starches (25-30% of the meal):
~100-150 g (e.g., rice, pasta, potatoes, or bread).
Protein (20-25% of the meal):
~100-150 g (e.g., meat, fish, tofu, legumes, or eggs).
Fats (Small portion):
~10-20 g (e.g., oils, dressings, or nuts).

Assume per meal 500 grams, a balanced meal contains 200 grams of animal product and 300 grams of plant based product
saved = balanced meal - vegan meal
