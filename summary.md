# Project Summary

MyDailyImpact is an app where users can track their impact for every time they eat a plant-based meal. The app has a smooth UI that utilizes user authentication, CRUD operations, and API endpoints to log and view meals and impact metrics in four areas (animals, CO2, water, and forestland saved). It also has a plant-based recipe recommending chatbot that uses RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) architecture with custom neural network reranking.
