The scripts is used to calculate the unit of carbon emissions, land and freshwater saved per plant-based meal, comparing to an average balanced meal.

A balanced meal typically consists of the following components:
Vegetables and Fruits (40-50% of the meal):
~200-250 g (e.g., salad, steamed vegetables, or fruit as a side).
Grains or Starches (25-30% of the meal):
~100-150 g (e.g., rice, pasta, potatoes, or bread).
Protein (20-25% of the meal):
~100-150 g (e.g., meat, fish, tofu, legumes, or eggs).
Fats (Small portion):
~10-20 g (e.g., oils, dressings, or nuts).

Based on the above, the following assumptions are made:
1. Every lunch and dinner contains 500 grams of food, and breakfast has 80% quantity of the other two meals.
2. A traditional balanced meal contains 40% animal product and 60% plant based product.
3. For simplicity, equal weighting is used to aggregate carbon emissions, land and freshwater per kg plant-based products from all available plant-based ingrediences. 
   While for animal products, since their higher impact, more nuance is considered. Weighted average based on world consumption is used in aggregation of different types of animal product 
   (e.g. poultry, pig, beef, etc) to the category animal product.

Input data for the calculation:
1. GHG emissions, land, water per food category: The paper (Poore & Nemecek, 2018) and downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food.
2. Meat consumption per meat category per country: FAO https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home
3. Population per country: from WorldBank https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL 

Calculation Steps:
1. Calculate weights of different types of animal product (e.g. poultry, pig, beef, etc) based on the world consumption data (2021). 
2. Aggregate impact per kg food per food category
   1) animal product aggregated using weights calculated in step 1
   2) other food categories aggregated using simple average of food ingredience. 
3. Calculate impact per balanced meal and plant-based meal
4. Calculate the impact of switching from balanced meal to plant-based meal
