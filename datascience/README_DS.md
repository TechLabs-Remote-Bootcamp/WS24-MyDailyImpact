# WS24-MyDailyImpact - Data Science

## Overview
This folder contains the data science features of our project:
 - Impact Calculation (Score)
 - ML Model: Carbon Emission Forecast
 - ML Model: Churn Prediction

The features are coded in Python and not integrated into the rest of the app due to limitations in time and experience.

## Virtual Environment

## Features
 ### Impact Calculation
 The impact per category per meal is calculated based on open-source data from statistic bureaus and research papers. All the data used in the code can be found in the data folder.
 The files 'score**.py' refers to these csv and xlsx files and make the calculation for corresponding categories. Refer to the comments in the codes for assumptions and methods used for the calculation.
 
 ### ML Model: Carbon Emission Forecast
 The code for this machine learning model is saved in 'Carbonprediction.ipynb'. The analysis is based on the synthetic user data created by the 'synthetic_activity_record_data_gen.py'. The Jupyter Notebook also includes data visualization for the user data. 
 
 ### ML Model: Churn Prediction
 The code for this machine learning model is saved in 'Churn_prediction.ipynb'. The analysis is based on the synthetic user data created by the 'synthetic_activity_record_data_gen.py'.
