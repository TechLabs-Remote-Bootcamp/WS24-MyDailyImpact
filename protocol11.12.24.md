<span style="color:grey">

**Weekly meetup:** currently with Google Meet, in future perhaps also via Zoom, the event is being organised via  [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?27969829-iVDWX) 
* **Google Meet**, convened by Elisabeth (disadvantage: duration only 1 hour, after which a new meeting link must be created): 
>Elisabeth asks for the email accounts of all team members to organise more easily.

* **Zoom:** Kate's university account, she checks the access 

**In addition to the weekly meetups meet with your fellow track members to discuss ideas/questions/approaches.**

## <span style="color:black"> __Fundamental discussion__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">
Following our discussion on Wednesday, our app wants to show the impact of choosing plant-based meals as opposed to meat-based ones (we will not be measuring the impact of choosing vegetarian or pescatarian meals as opposed to meat-based meals). 

We also aren't planning to show the nutritional impact on users for choosing plant-based meals, but rather focusing on their external impact on the environment and animals.

Further considerations:
* Strengthening the community concept (joint impact on saving animals lives)
* Including tips for "veganizing" a meal

* Practice of not eating meet is important, but no granularity (type of meal, units ...)

* Meat consumption varies depending on the country/continent


**Note for DS team:**
Make sure your data findings are relevant to what our app wants to show as you continue to research (creating the scoring systems the impact calculator will be based of). 
("Vegan Calculator" also part of Vivians presention)

<span style="color:grey">

* Already done: Evaluation of the brainstorming, organisation of the Miro board into Must-Have, Should have, Could have and Won't do for Backend, Frontend, Data Science and AI.

* Database setup through the **backend** 

* **Frontend** talk to backend 

* **DS team:** important to build a model / algorithm to integrate it in the database

* **AI team:** image-based meal recognition possibly retrofit due to time constraints
