Blanch the tomatoes by dropping them in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes. You will need to do them in batches. Transfer the tomatoes to a sink or tub filled with cold water. Peel the tomatoes and chop them coarsely. If you can remove some of the seeds as you go this will help. Layer the tomatoes in a large strainer - such as comes in a set for cooking spaghetti - with the salt. I try to use about 4 tablespoons but a bit more is okay. Much of it will run out with the water. Let the tomatoes drain for several hours to overnight in a cool spot. (Not in the fridge.) Don\\'t forget to keep them a little raised from the bottom of whatever pot you strain them into so they are not sitting in their own water. Ideally do this the night before you plan to proceed. Meanwhile deseed and mince the peppers. Peel and mince the shallots and garlic. Put them in the preserving kettle with 1 cup of the vinegar. Add the drained tomatoes when you have strained them for as long as you can stand. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Press the mixture through a fairly fine food mill. Discard any seeds and skins that will not go through. You will likely need to stop and clean the mill once or twice during the process. Return the pulp to the stove and add the remaining vinegar and the Sucanat. Grind the celery seed to a powder and mix it into the ketchup with the two paprikas and the ginger. The peppercorns and allspice should be tied up in cheesecloth or put in a very large tea-ball and added to the ketchup. Boil the ketchup stirring frequently until considerably reduced in volume and very thick. Expect this to take about 2 hours. About 45 minutes before you expect the ketchup to be thick enough to bottle put the canning jars into a large canner with water to cover them by one inch at least and bring to a boil. Boil the jars for 10 minutes. If your water is very hard add a shot of vinegar to the water to prevent lime build-up on the jars. When the ketchup is thick test it and adjust the salt and seasonings if necessary. Remove the black peppercorns and allspice and discard them. Fill the jars with the ketchup to within 1 cm of the rims. Seal with lids and rims which have been boiled for 5 minutes. Return the jars of ketchup to the boiling water bath and boil for 10 minutes. Remove them from the canner allow to cool check the seals label and store.

A thin layer of this works all day. Since it has the consistency of calamine lotion a little goes a long way. You can really only buy it in larger containers so you may want to pour some into a small container so it is easy to use (and carry around if you like- though I\\'ve never needed to carry any around with me if I put some on in the morning.) Put it on your face don\\'t drink it silly! Apply right after washing. The best facial cleaner I\\'ve found is Tersaseptic or Hibitane. They don\\'t over-dry skin and have lasting antibacterial properties. Baking soda mixed in with cleanser is supposed to be great for an occasional exfoliation (~2or 3 times/week) though I haven\\'t tried this myself. Since it\\'s very fine it isn\\'t too abrasive. Too abrasive is bad as it actually aggrivates skin and makes oiliness and acne worse. Some baking soda in bathwater makes your skin supersoft too (pour in about 1/4 cup when filling the tub.) Hydrogen Peroxide is a great anti-bacterial that doesn\\'t overly-dry your skin (like rubbing alchol does.) Wipe on with a cotton ball or cotton pad. Tea tree oil is good too (naturally antibacterial.)

The number of veggies you do, of course, depends on how many servings you need. I manage to fit all these veggies on a 15\" stone to do two servings. Sweet potato wedges are wonderful but only need about 20 minutes. The mushrooms are heavenly and are done when they start to sweat. I would not recommend doing broccoli, cauliflower or marinated veggies on the stone, however you can add a sprinkle of something or dry spice combos. It is great preparing your veggies in advance and just have your final cooking step left to do and all on one stone.; Recipe Category: Vegetable; Keywords: Canadian, Vegan, Free Of..., Weeknight, Oven, < 4 Hours, Easy; Recipe Ingredient Quantities: 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 6, NA; Recipe Ingredient Parts: potatoes, carrots, parsnips, onions, garlic, mushrooms; Calories: 317.9; Fat Content: 1.0; Saturated Fat Content: 0.2; Cholesterol Content: 0.0; Sodium Content: 109.9; Carbohydrate Content: 71.3; Fiber Content: 11.3; Sugar Content: 13.8; Protein Content: 10.7; Recipe Servings: 2.0; Recipe Instructions: If you are using a veggie that will discolor (potatoes) put them in a bowl and cover with water.

Add the garlic and mix well. Add enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball; if necessary add up to 1 additional tablespoon water. The dough should be fairly stiff and dry; if it is too wet it will not roll well. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15 seconds in the food processor; the dough should be smooth. With your hands shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches thick and 6 inches long. With a sharp knife cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick slices. The next step uses oil so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve. Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface. Lightly oil the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter. Papadams must be rolled extremely thin maximum 1/16 inch. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin gently pull it off. Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper. Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the rolling surface carefully place them on large baking sheets. The traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described below; you can also bake them in a 300F oven for about 15 to 25 minutes or until crisp and dry. The cooking time may vary beyond this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled dough. Cool them on a rack. To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner don\\'t bake them; first allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by placing them in a very low oven (less than 200F) for 1 to 2 hours turning occasionally. Dry the papadams until they are just slightly flexible and show no moisture; they should not brown or bake however. At this point the papadams may be stacked flat and stored in an airtight container until needed; they will keep for months if stored properly. When ready to serve heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet; the oil should be hot but not smoking; a drop of water flicked into the skillet should sizzle immediately. One at a time drop the papadams into the hot oil. Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at the edges; it will quickly fry and become crisp. Remove it before it turns brown. Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels and eat them immediately.; Recipe Time Category: Medium',\n 'Name: Healthy Corn and Tomato Salad; Cooking Time Minutes: 30; Preparation Time Minutes: 10; Total Recipe Minutes: 40; Description: Description not provided.

Goes well with chicken pork or shrimp. The longer the meat soaks in the marinade the stronger the flavor will be. Poking holes in the meat with a fork will also help the flavor soak into the meat.

Wash peppers and cut in half. Remove seeds and stems. Place upside down (skin side up) on a cookie sheet coated with olive oil spray. Bake for 10-15 minutes or so until skin of pepper is seriously black. Make sure there are no sparks or actively burning ashes on the peppers and place peppers in a brown bag for about 10-15 minutes. This steams the peppers so the skins easily peel off. Rinsing peppers takes away all the roasted flavor so don't let me catch you doing that. Let cool so you can touch them. Skin will peel off easily. Cut halves into strips or however you need them to be cut. Now you know how to roast a red pepper! Good for: Chicken cheese sauces tomato sauces topped on foccacia bread or a million other things! You can also roast a pepper by placing it directly on the burner of a gas stove (NOT ELECTRIC!) turning with tongs every few minutes till skin is black.

Pour 1/4 cup water into the flour and start mixing with the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add remaining water as required until the flour comes together to form a dough. If the mixture is too dry and falls apart add some more water; if it is too sticky and sticks to your fingers dust it with some more flour. Now knead the dough well for about 5 to 10 minutes; the more you knead it the softer your rotis will be. Cover and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes. Heat a heavy skillet on a low flame. Meanwhile divide the dough into 6 lemon-sized balls and roll into 7-inch circles on a generously floured board using a rolling pin adding sprinklings of flour to keep the roti from sticking to the rolling pin. Once the skillet is sufficiently hot place one roti on it and increase the flame to medium-high. After about 20 seconds turn the roti and cook on the other side. When small-medium bubbles start to appear on the surface of the roti (about 1 minute) remove it from the skillet remove the skillet from the flame and turn the roti over directly on the flame. It should puff up completely; you might need some practice with it. Once it puffs up remove it from the flame and serve hot with any vegetable side!

I got it from \"Breadtime\", by Susan Jane Cheney (a great resource for bread bakers!); Recipe Category: Yeast Breads; Keywords: Breads, Grains, Vegan, Low Cholesterol, Healthy, Kosher, Weeknight, Oven, Easy, Inexpensive; Recipe Ingredient Quantities: 3, 3/4, 7 1/2 - 8, 2 1/2, 2; Recipe Ingredient Parts: water, dry yeast, whole wheat flour, salt; Calories: 1655.1; Fat Content: 25.0; Saturated Fat Content: 3.7; Cholesterol Content: 0.0; Sodium Content: 2927.3; Carbohydrate Content: 324.5; Fiber Content: 48.5; Sugar Content: 1.9; Protein Content: 60.0; Recipe Servings: nan; Recipe Instructions: Proof yeast in half a cup of the water with about a teaspoon of flour- let it sit covered until it becomes bubbly& active. Combine the rest of the water with the yeast/water in a large bowl and gradually add about half of the flour. Stir the mixture about 100 times in the same direction until it is well-mixed and strands are beginning to form. Stir in the salt and oil. Add the remaining flour half a cup at a time stirring well until it is too stiff to stir with a spoon. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for about 20 minutes adding flour as nescessary to keep the dough from sticking to the board. The dough should be springy and nice to work with. When it has been sufficiently kneaded cover it with a damp cloth for about 10 minutes and wash and grease the bowl lightly. After it has rested knead the dough a few more times (it should feel really nice by now!) and place it in the bowl covered with the damp cloth a plastic bag and maybe a plate. Let the dough rise until it springs back when you stick your finger in it and it is about twice the size as it was before (this takes about 2 hours; longer or shorter depending on the room temperature- I prefer a longer (cooler) rise because it allows the flavour to develop more... but sometimes you just don\\'t have time for that sort of thing). Deflate the dough by punching or kneading it a few times and let it rise again- this time it should take about half the amount of time as it did before. When the dough has risen twice deflate it again and cover it with the damp cloth again for about 10 minutes (to let the gluten relax apparently.. it makes it easier to manage if you do this) then divide it into and shape it into loaves buns etc. Let the shaped dough rise on a baking sheet or in a loaf-pan for about an hour maybe- it will rise a bit more in the oven. Slash the top of the bread if you want so that it doesn\\'t bust open in the oven. Bake at 400º for 20 minutes and then turn the oven down to 350º and bake for 20-30 minutes longer until the loaf is a lovely brown and sounds hollow when you thump it on the bottom. (Buns and smaller loaves take a shorter time). Try to let the loaf cool (out side of the loaf pan or it will get a bit soggy) before you tear into it.; Recipe Time Category: Very Long',\n 'Name: Carrot Salad; Cooking Time Minutes: 10; Preparation Time Minutes: 10; Total Recipe Minutes: 20; Description: Serve this as part of a Moroccan style meal.

Allow dough to go through one knead cycle and one rise cycle only. Line very large baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour and scrape dough onto lightly floured work surface. Using dough scraper divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Using floured hands transfer dough pieces to prepared baking sheet forming flat irregular oval shapes and spacing at least 2 1/2-inches apart.

Position rack in upper third of oven just below highest position and preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Press fingertips into dough in several places to dimple surface (characteristic of this bread).

Divide dough into 2 equal portions and flatten each into a 1 1/2 inch thick oval. Fold oval in half once lengthwise and pinch seam to make an elongate loaf. Sprinkle cornmeal on a baking sheet and place the loaves on the sheet seam side down. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees F) until about doubled in bulk. Place a shallow pan of hot water on the lower shelf of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Make shallow slashes in tops of loaves with a razor blade or finely serrated knife held at a 30 degree angle. Place the loaves in the oven and immediately spray them and the oven walls with water from a fine mister and avoid spraying oven light. Repeat this spraying 3 additional times at one minute intervals. Continue baking for 30 to 40 minutes or until brown but remove pan of water from oven after the first 15 minutes. Remove loaves from baking sheet and cool on wire racks. To proof sourdough culture start with 1/2 cup of culture and stir into it 1 1/2 cups warm water and 1 1/2 cups flour. Cover with plastic and let sit 8 to 12 hours (the longer it sits the more \\'sour\\' your bread will taste).
