# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Always Create a New Branch ‚û°Ô∏è

Never commit directly to the main branch.üö®‚ö†Ô∏è

Always create a new `feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `design`, or `refactor` branch off the main before starting any work. This ensures that the main branch remains stable and production-ready.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short_description
```

## Commit Message Format ü´Ç

### Structure:

Commit messages must strictly follow this format:

```

```

### Components:

- **<type>**: The type of change. Options:
  - `feature`: For new features or functionalities.
  - `fix`: For bug fixes.
  - `docs`: For documentation updates.
  - `test`: For test cases or testing updates.
  - `refactor`: For refactoring code.
- **<Message>**: A short, clear description of the change made.

### Examples:

- ` feature: add user authentication`
- ` fix: resolve login issue on empty password`
- ` docs: update API documentation for user endpoints`
- ` test: add test cases for payment module`
- ` refactor: optimize database queries in reports`
